## V8-bears-team-05

Add project decription here ...

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Then an Express server was added in the `server` directory. The server is proxied via the `proxy` key in `package.json`.

## Using this project

Clone the project, change into the directory and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v8-bears-team-05.git
cd bears-team-05
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file for environment variables in your server.

You can start the server on its own with the command:

```bash
npm run server
```

Run the React application on its own with the command:

```bash
npm start
```

Run both applications together with the command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can create an optimized production build with the command:

```bash
npm run build
```

The React application will run on port 3000 and the Express server on port 3001.
